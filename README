=====================
Project Criteria Met:
=====================

A page to add Directors/Actors
A page to add Movies
A page to add Actor and Movie Relations
A page to add Director and Movie Relations
A page to display Movie information including the option to add and display Reviews and Rating
A searchbar in the sidebar to conduct searches, it then displays the search result on the main area

All pages are properly linked so that they redirect to the correct pages e.g. clicking on Actor's name would redirect to his/her info page
We pretty much implemented all the functionality that was asked for.

=======================
Team Work Distribution:
=======================
Most of the work was distributed fairly even since we met up to do pair programming for the bulk of the project. Otherwise we would ask each other to work
on certain features/bugs in the website when we couldn't pair program. Yuxi helped Arun learn a lot of php cuz Arun didn't know much.

===============
Extra Features:
===============
The site was styled by Yuxi using CSS. 
There is a sidebar that is constant navigational nexus throughout the entire website.

========================
Improvements to be Made:
========================
There should be a better way to add Actor/Director - Movie Relations. It's kind of a pain the way it is set up right now.
Search autocomplete would be a nice feature to implement.

An aspect to improve in terms of teamwork would be to split up features more effeciently



TAKE NOTE:
The "Submit Review" button on the movie information page has the same functionality as "Add Comment", we just decided to name it "Submit Review"

When creating the tables and loading the files, be sure to run the commands in the directory contain load.sql and create.sql

The site looks best in fullscreen
